# Linked-List<br>
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image:<br>

In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.<br>
<br>
# Types Of Linked List:<br>
1. Singly Linked List<br>
It is the simplest type of linked list in which every node contains some data and a pointer to the next node of the same data type. <br>

2. Doubly Linked List<br>
A doubly linked list or a two-way linked list is a more complex type of linked list that contains a pointer to the next as well as the previous node in sequence. <br>

3. Circular Linked List<br>
A circular linked list is that in which the last node contains the pointer to the first node of the list. <br>
